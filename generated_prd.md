# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Goal

We are building a PRD generator, a web app or a chat bot, to simplify and streamline the process of creating PRDs. The main problem we are trying to solve is the tedious and time-consuming process of manual PRD creation. We aim to offer users a product that can take a meeting transcript or conversation as input, and generate a comprehensive and realistic PRD with clear goals and actionable suggestions.
